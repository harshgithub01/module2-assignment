	   	   <p>
	              Butter Chicken is one of the top orders at any Indian restaurant in the West and for good reasonâ€”it is delicious. This sultry poultry dish tastes great with kaali daal (black lentils), naan, and a green salad.

	   	   <h3>Palak Paneer</h3>
	   	   <p>
	   	      The most popular paneer recipe at Indian restaurants is, by far, palak paneer. It is a mildly flavored dish that is super healthy, as it is nothing more than spinach and cottage cheese (the paneer), along with the typical Indian spices.

	   	   <h3>Chicken Vindaloo Curry</h3>
	   	   <p>
	   	      This is a mild and sweetly spiced recipe for chicken vindaloo curry. Contrary to current belief, curries do not have to be hot and fiery and, in fact, never started out that way in India. Creating the curry paste is the most important part of this dish, so don't skimp on the ingredients.
